# iCMS

## Description
Generative AI powered content management system. This is an educational project showcasing automated text generation and storing it as a tree-structure.

As part of the project, I've experimented with a new techstack:

- **Deno** as a runtime.
- **Hono** as a backend framework.
- **MongoDB Atlas** as a document storage.
